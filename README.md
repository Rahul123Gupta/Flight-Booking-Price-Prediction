✈️ Flight Booking Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various factors such as departure time, duration, airline, source, destination, and other related features. It demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

📖 About the Project

I developed this project as part of my Data Science learning journey to understand how predictive modeling works in real-world scenarios. The goal was to build a model that can accurately forecast flight prices to help customers make better booking decisions.

📊 Key Highlights

Performed Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in flight pricing

Performed Feature Engineering on variables like departure time, route, airline, and duration

Built Machine Learning Models including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical flight booking data with features such as airline, source, destination, total stops, journey date, departure and arrival time, duration, and price.

💡 Insights Found

Flight prices vary significantly depending on the time of booking and travel date

Certain airlines consistently have higher prices for specific routes

Duration and number of stops impact the final ticket price

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement Time Series Forecasting for seasonal flight price trends

Deploy a web app using Streamlit to predict flight prices in real-time

Include dynamic features like demand, holidays, and special events for more accurate predictions

🧠 What I Learned
